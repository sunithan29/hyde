In this project a novel architecture to secure an Enterprise Network was implementated. It utilizes “Behavior based Anomaly Detection”
approach for classifying malicious network traffic from benign network traffic. The unsupervised machine learning model uses features
extracted from network flows which evolves over the period of time by observing the network behavior, hence improving the clustering
accuracy. K-Means clustering algorithm is used for the above classification.
