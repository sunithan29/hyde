title: "Enterprise Network Security and Monitoring"
---

A novel architecture and implementation of monitoring and securing an Enterprise Network is presented. It utilizes “Behavior based Anomaly Detection” approach for classifying malicious network traffic from benign network traffic. The unsupervised machine learning model uses features extracted from network flows which evolves over the period of time by observing the network behavior, hence improving the clustering accuracy. K-Means clustering algorithm is used for the above classification. More features can be extracted from the flow to make the unsupervised ML model more robust.
