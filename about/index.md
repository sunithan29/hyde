I am a Research Associate at [Indian Institute of Science](http://www.iisc.ac.in/). I spend my time  exploring a few problems in the space of computer security, applied cryptography, and using techniques in machine learning to detect anomalies in a network.  My recent research has focused on exploring authentication for iot networks. 

Prior to this, I obtained a Bachelor's in Engineering from VTU in 2014. During my final year in Engineering as a major in Electrical and Electronics, I built an electric vehicle - [Stride](https://www.facebook.com/evstride/), that was designed to incorporate recent trends in green technology which was featured on [The Hindu](http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/ep-campus/article6140253.ece). I founded  ‘Irwe’ in 2014 which aimed at designing robust and compact electric vehicles for the traffic police. The success of project ‘Irwe’ and it’s subsequent implementation and adoption by the State Government of Karnataka inspired me to build scalable solutions to solve problems through technology. In 2016, I co-founded a startup, GramSolar, that  helped increase adoption of technologies for sustainable farming systems with the experiment base set up in Shingave village, India.
